make issue about annotating "tener que"...in AnCora there is at least one case with "tiene que ser" annotated as cc(ser, que)...should be mark right?

inconsistencies in spanish AnCora wrt the annotation of "Mira, ". I think it should be discourse...
related to above: annotation of confirmational "you know"
also "tu sabes"

inconsistent annotation of "cada vez que" in AnCora

check xcomps....especially secondary predication (qued√≥ __, nos hicimos miembros, etc.)

error in pos and dep : 3LB-CAST-t5-7-s4 (AnCora train)...pintas should be VERB
