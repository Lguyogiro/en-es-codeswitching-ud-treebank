make issue about annotating "tener que"...in AnCora there is at least one case with "tiene que ser" annotated as cc(ser, que)...should be mark right?

inconsistencies in spanish AnCora wrt the annotation of "Mira, ". I think it should be discourse...
related to above: annotation of confirmational "you know"
also "tu sabes"

inconsistent annotation of "cada vez que" in AnCora

check xcomps....especially secondary predication (qued√≥ __, nos hicimos miembros, etc.)

error in pos and dep : 3LB-CAST-t5-7-s4 (AnCora train)...pintas should be VERB

need a big fat issue about reparanda, because a lot of these trees are looking funky.
    reparandum when an aux is repeated eg "es, you know, es _"

annotation of "es que" in AnCora seems wrong...sometimes the complement is marked as ccomp of "es" ??

treatment of "like" needs to be made consistent

in AnCora the annotations of " a little ADJ" might not be consistent...some have obl(little, ADJ) others have advmod

"o sea" weirdly annotated in AnCora...with "sea" as a NOUN...also inconsistent in gsd

"oh my god" not annotated as a fixed expression in GUM...this seems like the right analysis, not discourse(oh, V) and discourse(god, V)

AUX vs VERB for cop

"el de N" construction...

"like" ...."estaban todas like en little cups"

sometimes the paralinguistic things (imitating sounds etc) are syntactically relevant eg "sometimes I hear the &=imit:game_sounds"...we should probably keep this?
